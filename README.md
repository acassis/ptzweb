This simple HTML code to control a PTZ camera over Internet.

If the user press arrows buttons during 1 second it will move camera faster
If the user press arrows buttons and release mouse buttom fast (less than 500ms) it will move camera slowlly.

It calls the "pelco" command (code from http://sourceforge.net/projects/pelco-ptz) running on your server.
In your server you need to use a RS-485 interface (i.e. a USB/RS485 converter) connected to PTZ Camera.

Be free to use this example as you want, no license required.
